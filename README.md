## Overview

`Locus for Unity` is an open-source AI Agent for Unity projects.

- **In-editor operations**: write C# code, read and modify Unity objects and assets, and complete the full feature development workflow
- **Runtime analysis and debugging**: autonomously operate and capture runtime state to help fix bugs and optimize performance
- **Automated knowledge system**: automatically summarize conversation requirements into design documents and preserve project understanding in long-term memory
- **Visual version control**: provide a visual version control interface with semantic diff analysis and conflict handling for Unity YAML assets
- **Multiple model support**: support subscription account sign-in and compatibility with multiple LLM API capabilities

Locus is currently in early testing (`v0.2.2`). We welcome you to try it and share feedback through Issues. Your input is highly valuable to us.

## Installation

Windows is currently the only supported platform. We plan to add macOS support soon.

We recommend installing from the Releases build. For the post-installation setup flow, see [Quick Start](https://unity.farlocus.com/en/overview/install-and-setup).

## Build from Source

This repository uses `bun` + `Tauri 2`, with Windows as the primary development and build platform.

### Run in Development

```powershell
bun tauri dev
```

This command starts the Vite development server and opens the Tauri desktop app.

### Build

```powershell
bun tauri build
```

This command rebuilds the merged Roslyn DLL, builds the frontend, generates the third-party license bundle, and packages the desktop app. The default output is a Windows `NSIS` installer under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

## Releases

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/r1n7aro/Locus/releases) for published installers and release notes.

## License

The desktop app installer does not include `docs/node_modules` or the Mint documentation build toolchain.

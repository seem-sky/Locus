//! Built-in hot-reload self-test: drives the WHOLE hot-reload surface
//! (H0–H7) against the connected Unity Editor through the same internal
//! interfaces the agent tools use — coordinator baselines, the sidecar
//! compile, the pipe — and reports a step-by-step diagnostic log.
//!
//! Coverage maps to the public hot-reload feature matrix, positive and negative:
//!   • positives: method/property(get+set)/indexer/event/operator/
//!     conversion/ctor body edits, expression-bodied members, lambda +
//!     closure (including NEW captures), local functions, anonymous types,
//!     pattern matching, nested types, iterator (coroutine) bodies, async
//!     body edits and async↔sync, added methods (shim→shim chains) +
//!     fields (instance and static, across separate batches),
//!     instance-initializer edits, field deletion, field RETYPE (the
//!     remove+add decomposition — a live instance reads the new field's
//!     default), added-const inlining, signature changes
//!     (params / ref→out / static flip / rename) with call-site
//!     verification, accessibility narrowing, using add/remove with
//!     whole-file rehook, enum append, new files, new types in existing
//!     files (top-level and nested), struct method bodies, interface-impl
//!     bodies, deletions (members, properties, Unity messages, whole
//!     files); plus edit-mode reloading of EDITOR-assembly code, in-flight
//!     delegates following detours, Unity message body edits, hot-added Unity
//!     message drivers (PlayerLoop, lifecycle catch-up, plus component-proxy
//!     forwarding for physics/trigger and non-physics messages), a
//!     runtime diagnostic for hot-added MonoBehaviour AddComponent(Type), store-held
//!     static persistence across patches, generic-typed and nested-type
//!     field additions, #if-block edits, iterator→plain conversions,
//!     extension-method additions (with the call site surviving LATER
//!     batches where the accepted patch image is also in scope), a
//!     five-file batch, generic method bodies (generic methods AND
//!     methods of generic types) via the B1 remove+add shim path with
//!     their untouched callers re-detoured, added members reaching the
//!     original type's PRIVATE field/method/static through the C0-measured
//!     access caps (C2′a), the same access from the compiler-generated
//!     SUB-METHODS of added members — async state machines, capturing
//!     lambdas, iterators (C2′b), an added member constructing through a
//!     PRIVATE constructor (the newobj creation-node check), a kept
//!     body touching a cross-file internal type (binding-model alignment
//!     guard), the B2 accessor additions: a new PROPERTY
//!     (write/compound-assign/read through get_/set_ shims), a new INDEXER
//!     overload, a new accessor EVENT (subscribe/unsubscribe), and a new
//!     AUTO-PROPERTY (store-backed: default for existing instances, value
//!     persistent across calls, initializer on new instances, ++ across a
//!     later batch), plus nameof(...) over an added auto-property; and the B3
//!     cross-asmdef shapes against a SEPARATE assembly (Lib/ + .asmdef):
//!     a lib method body edit observed through an Assembly-CSharp caller,
//!     a lib signature change whose CROSS-ASSEMBLY caller must join the
//!     batch (M3 names the Assembly-CSharp file first, then the covered
//!     batch goes hot), and a lib added method called from Assembly-CSharp
//!     through the cross-assembly shim, plus a lib added property through
//!     cross-assembly accessor shims; and the B6 partial shapes: a type
//!     split across TWO part files (both with private instance fields),
//!     where editing one part's body pulls the never-edited sibling in as
//!     a baseline, then editing both parts in one batch keeps the merged
//!     patch copy complete. The Enter Play Mode Options matrix
//!     (B5) is probed right before the play transition: the run logs
//!     whether the play-enter domain reload is enabled, and the Phase-2
//!     editor patch is deliberately carried across the transition — E02
//!     asserts the mode-matched outcome (the detour survives with Reload
//!     Domain disabled, it dies with the classic reload).
//!   • negatives (must come back COLD with the precise reason): generic
//!     bodies whose compiled caller is OUTSIDE the batch (named caller
//!     file), generic-type constructor bodies, constructor/
//!     finalizer surface and finalizer bodies, virtual members (including
//!     virtual PROPERTY additions — plain property/indexer/event additions
//!     are hot since B2), field-like event additions, struct
//!     field layout, enum value edits, attribute edits, const edits,
//!     unsupported Unity message names/signatures, interface changes,
//!     base-list changes, partial-type FIELD layout changes (body edits
//!     are hot since B6), delegate signature changes,
//!     conversions returning the declaring type, added members whose
//!     SIGNATURE names a non-public type (C2′a relaxes body access only),
//!     uncovered call sites (named caller file); plus the shim-only
//!     "parked new surface" verdict for caller-less additions and the
//!     untracked-input verdict for .asmdef edits (assembly restructuring
//!     always needs unity_recompile), along with B2's pointed cold guards:
//!     full-property ++, ??= set-skip, auto-property ref/out, and compound
//!     indexers with non-repeatable index expressions; plus the N30+ extra
//!     cold surface: type-kind flips (class↔struct), static-constructor
//!     bodies, explicit-interface-implementation bodies, the enum-append
//!     guards (non-literal value, value conflict) and enum removal, const
//!     and constructor and finalizer REMOVAL, field-modifier changes,
//!     operator additions, record types (rejected on presence — created
//!     fresh so the C# 9 syntax never compiles), the M6 using-rehook gates
//!     (non-literal const / non-literal static initializer / generic member /
//!     explicit-interface / finalizer), and the remaining B6 partial
//!     boundaries (part add/remove, new-part declaration, using-in-partial,
//!     part-count change, initializer change, partial-method-twice). The
//!     Burst, unsupported-operator and default-interface-method gate variants
//!     stay in the HotDiff unit tests (package / unreachable / runtime-DIM).
//!
//! Flow: with the editor connected and NOT playing, it materializes a test
//! corpus under Assets/LocusHotReloadSelfTest, imports + recompiles it as
//! the baseline (a real domain reload), enters play mode, spawns the test
//! component, then hot-reloads one feature after another, verifying
//! observable behavior through `unity_execute_code` snippets. Added-member
//! behavior is always asserted through a PRE-EXISTING member (`Probe`)
//! re-pointed at the new surface: snippets compile against the original
//! assembly metadata, which never contains hot-added members. The hot-added
//! MonoBehaviour AddComponent diagnostic uses reflection for the same reason.
//! Every step
//! is atomic: a failed apply reverts its file(s) on disk and in the ledger
//! so one rejected patch cannot poison the following batches.
//!
//! It finishes by leaving play mode, waiting for the automatic convergence
//! (H6), and deleting the corpus.
//!
//! Triggered from Settings > Code Analysis; progress streams to the UI via

// change. The static reflection helpers (Spawn/ReadBeat) give the Rust snippets
// a stable entry point even though the type is invisible to snippet metadata,
// and Bump() is invoked directly on the retained instance. The static Ping()
// preserves P09's original through-Probe assertion.

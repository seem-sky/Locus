# Unity Editor UI Skill

## Summary
Use when the task asks for a Unity Editor UI that edits scene data, serialized objects, assets, or project data inside the Unity Editor. Ignore runtime or player-facing UI and pipeline work with no editor UI surface.

## Content
Use this skill when the task needs a reliable Unity Editor interface for editing data inside the Unity Editor.

Goal: ship editor tools that are fast to build, hard to misuse, visually native, and correct under undo, multi-object, and prefab workflows.

## Scope

Covers Unity Editor UI for editing data: custom Inspectors, EditorWindows, PropertyDrawers, the UI Toolkit / IMGUI / Odin choice, and editor workflow polish. Out of scope: runtime or player-facing UI, and import/build-pipeline, scene-handle, or menu-only work with no editor UI surface.

## Core working model

Before coding, determine four things:

- what data is being edited
- where that data lives
- whether the workflow is single-target, multi-target, or batch-driven
- what editor foundations already exist in the project

Read the environment first. Reuse any exposed Unity version, scene state, package/dependency context, and current editor conventions.

Ask the user only when a workflow-critical detail is missing. At minimum, clarify only these when unknown:

- edited data type
- host object or asset
- selection-driven vs batch-driven workflow
- existing editor UI patterns to match

Do not ask for optional style preferences before making the main product decision.

## Version and dependency discipline

- Target the active Unity version first. Write code and choose controls that exist in that version.
- If version is unclear, choose the safest version-compatible path instead of assuming the newest APIs.
- Default to UI Toolkit for new editor UI.
- Use IMGUI when extending a mature IMGUI editor, when the tool is genuinely tiny, or when a required interaction is awkward in UI Toolkit.
- Use `IMGUIContainer` to isolate blocked legacy sections inside a UI Toolkit shell instead of rewriting the whole tool.
- If the project already uses Odin Inspector or Sirenix editor infrastructure, prefer reusing `OdinEditorWindow`, `OdinMenuEditorWindow`, drawers, validators, and `PropertyTree`-based flows instead of rebuilding the same plumbing.
- Ask before migrating a substantial existing IMGUI tool to UI Toolkit.

## Choose the host surface first

- Prefer a custom `Inspector` when the workflow centers on one selected `MonoBehaviour`, `ScriptableObject`, importer, or asset.
- Prefer an `EditorWindow` when the workflow needs search, list management, comparison, preview, cross-asset editing, multi-selection, auditing, or batch apply.
- Prefer a `PropertyDrawer` when the same custom field UI must be reused across multiple inspectors.
- Use a hybrid when both surfaces help: fast object-local edits stay in an Inspector, while heavy browsing or batch actions move into an EditorWindow.

## Default decisions when the user does not care

- One serialized target with mostly per-object edits: `UI Toolkit` + custom `Inspector`.
- Cross-asset editing, search, lists, previews, or batch apply: `UI Toolkit` + `EditorWindow`.
- One reusable field experience repeated across many types: `PropertyDrawer`.
- Existing `OnInspectorGUI()` or `OnGUI()` codebase with small scope: extend with `IMGUI`.
- Existing Odin-heavy project: reuse Odin for inspector-heavy and serialization-heavy flows unless the user explicitly asks for a pure Unity-native implementation.

## Match the request to a proven tool archetype

### 1. Detail inspector
Use for one selected target.

Preferred structure:

- header with title, object summary, and status
- primary settings section
- references or dependencies section
- preview or computed summary section
- warnings and fix hints near the affected fields
- advanced foldout
- actions footer

### 2. Collection manager
Use for assets, entries, or records that benefit from browsing and selection.

Preferred structure:

- toolbar with search, filters, refresh, and create actions
- `TwoPaneSplitView`
- `ListView` on the left
- detail, preview, or embedded inspector on the right
- footer or bottom action bar with selection count and apply actions

### 3. Batch audit or fixer
Use for validation, cleanup, migration, or repair workflows.

Preferred structure:

- scope and filters at the top
- explicit `Scan` action
- result list with counts and clear issue labels
- preview of affected objects or changes
- `Apply` action separated from `Scan`
- success, skipped, and failed result reporting

### 4. Reusable micro-editor
Use when a single field or nested type needs a better editor everywhere.

Preferred structure:

- compact single-row editing by default
- inline validation or mini-help when needed
- foldout or expanded mode only for advanced details

### 5. Wizard or guided flow
Use for sequential setup tasks.

Preferred structure:

- step list or tab bar
- one main action per step
- no deep foldout nesting
- clear next-state guidance after completion

## Build in this order

1. Write the UI tree in text before coding.
   - sections
   - lists and detail panes
   - validation surfaces
   - action zones
2. Decide file layout early.
   - `Editor/FooEditor.cs`
   - optional `FooEditor.uxml`
   - optional `FooEditor.uss`
   - optional row-template UXML for list items
3. Build the shell first.
4. Bind serialized data.
5. Wire validation and preview.
6. Wire actions and undo.
7. Add persistence and all non-happy-path states.
8. Polish spacing, alignment, labels, and iconography last.

## UXML, USS, and C# division of responsibility

- Put stable structure in UXML.
- Put stable styling in USS.
- Put dynamic behavior, data binding, and tool logic in C#.
- Use pure C# UI Toolkit for very small or highly dynamic tools.
- Keep custom USS semantic and restrained.
- Avoid large inline style blocks in C# except for trivial one-offs.
- Name key elements that code must query.
- Keep layout, styling, and logic separable when the tool is expected to live beyond a quick prototype.

## Serialization and data flow rules

- Prefer `SerializedObject`, `SerializedProperty`, `PropertyField`, and binding paths over direct field mutation.
- In custom inspectors, prefer `CreateInspectorGUI()`.
- In inspector UIs, let the Inspector perform its implicit binding after you return the visual tree.
- In editor windows that edit serialized targets, bind the root to a `SerializedObject` or host an `InspectorElement`.
- Prefer `PropertyField` for standard serialized members. Reach for custom controls only where they materially improve clarity, workflow, or validation.
- For lists, prefer `ListView` bound to a serialized list or a backing collection. Use row templates and `makeItem`/`bindItem` for custom visuals. Do not instantiate a full row tree per item manually for large lists.
- When polishing an existing inspector, consider embedding the default inspector inside a `Foldout` or a dedicated section with `InspectorElement.FillDefaultInspector()` before rewriting every field.
- Avoid ad hoc reflection traversal when a serialized path or an Odin property tree already exists.
- Query visual elements once and keep references; avoid repeated string queries inside high-frequency callbacks.

## Undo, prefab, and multi-object correctness

- SerializedObject-based editing is the first choice because it naturally supports undo, multi-object workflows, and prefab overrides.
- If direct mutation is unavoidable, call `Undo.RecordObject()` or `Undo.RegisterCompleteObjectUndo()` before changing data.
- Use the dedicated `Undo` APIs for creation, destruction, parenting, and component add/remove flows.
- Add `[CanEditMultipleObjects]` whenever the semantics are valid.
- When a UI supports multiple targets, make mixed states obvious and avoid pretending one target represents all of them.
- When direct edits touch prefab instances, record prefab instance property modifications where required.
- Do not bypass serialization for convenience unless the tradeoff is explicit and acceptable.

## Validation and user guidance

- Validate close to the field that caused the issue.
- Also keep one small top-level status summary when the tool benefits from a quick read.
- Use reactive tracking for warnings, badges, computed summaries, previews, and button enabled states.
- Disable apply or destructive actions when the current state is invalid, unchanged, or selectionless.
- For destructive or large batch operations, show a preview and affected count before execution.
- Separate `Scan` from `Apply` in audit-style tools.
- After execution, report exact counts: succeeded, skipped, failed.
- Prefer concise guidance and fix hints over long explanatory paragraphs.

## Visual polish rules

- Aim for native Unity Editor polish, not flashy runtime-game styling.
- Build strong hierarchy: header, content sections, warnings, actions.
- Do not dump raw fields into one flat form unless the data is truly trivial.
- Use one visual emphasis system only: a status chip, a restrained accent, or a clearly primary button. Keep the rest quiet.
- Favor clean spacing, strong labels, and consistent alignment over decorative styling.
- Use Unity-native controls first: `PropertyField`, `Foldout`, `HelpBox`, `Toolbar`, `ListView`, `TwoPaneSplitView`, `ScrollView`, and `InspectorElement`.
- Keep custom styling restrained. Avoid thick borders, gradients, saturated fills, giant cards, and game-menu aesthetics.
- Align custom controls with the native inspector rhythm. When custom fields sit beside native fields, use the same alignment classes and spacing conventions.
- Use `HelpBox` for warnings and guidance by default.
- Keep primary actions easy to find. Keep destructive actions visually separated.
- Test both editor themes before calling the tool polished.

## States every editor tool should handle

- empty state
- invalid selection state
- mixed multi-selection state
- loading or scanning state
- no-results state
- success and failure feedback after actions

## Persistence and reopen behavior

- Persist the UI state that matters to returning users.
- Use `viewDataKey` for foldouts, selections, tabs, trees, list selection, and scroll positions when supported.
- Use `SessionState` for session-only filters, search strings, and last-opened tabs when appropriate.
- Use `EditorPrefs` only for durable user preferences that should survive editor restarts and are not project data.
- On domain reload or window reopen, restore a useful working state instead of a blank reset whenever possible.

## Performance rules

- Do not rescan assets or rebuild expensive previews on every repaint or keystroke.
- Debounce search and filtering in windows that can touch many assets.
- Rebuild only the regions that changed; prefer data refresh over full visual-tree reconstruction.
- Keep `ListView` item creation cheap and bind logic deterministic.
- Delay expensive previews until the selection changes or the preview area becomes visible.
- Avoid expensive `AssetDatabase` work in high-frequency UI callbacks.
- For long scans or migrations, show progress and make reruns safe.

## Practical speed shortcuts

- Existing inspector, mostly default fields, but needs better summary and actions: keep default fields and wrap them in a stronger shell before rebuilding everything.
- Selection-driven browser or manager: start with `EditorWindow` + `Toolbar` + `TwoPaneSplitView` + `ListView` + detail pane.
- Reusable nested type editor: start with a `PropertyDrawer` before considering a full custom inspector.
- Tiny action tool: build a small native-looking window; avoid overengineering a framework-heavy solution.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Writing direct field changes when a `SerializedProperty` path exists.
- Rebuilding an entire UI just to add one or two actions.
- Migrating mature IMGUI tools for style reasons alone.
- Hiding critical warnings inside collapsed advanced sections.
- Styling the tool heavily before workflow, validation, and undo are correct.
- Creating long flat inspectors when the data clearly wants hierarchy.
- Building large list tools without virtualization-friendly controls.
- Mixing layout, style, and behavior in one giant method for a tool that will be maintained.

## Escalate when the product choice changes workflow meaningfully

- Ask before migrating a substantial IMGUI tool to UI Toolkit.
- Ask before choosing Inspector vs EditorWindow when both are plausible and the wrong choice would reshape the workflow.
- Ask before replacing familiar project patterns with a new visual language.
- Ask before removing or collapsing advanced controls that users may depend on.

## Delivery contract

Every delivered editor UI should end with:

- chosen host surface and UI technology, with a one-line rationale
- target files added or changed
- edited data flow summary
- validation and preview behavior
- undo and redo behavior
- multi-object behavior
- prefab behavior
- persistence behavior across reload or reopen
- a concise manual verification checklist

## Verification checklist

- selection, empty, invalid, and mixed states render correctly
- undo and redo work for every mutation path
- serialized values survive domain reload
- multi-object editing works or is explicitly disabled
- prefab overrides are preserved
- window reopen restores a sensible working state
- lists remain usable with realistic data volume
- layout stays readable at narrow inspector widths and common window widths
- light and dark themes both read clearly
- no null-reference or missing-reference path silently breaks the UI
